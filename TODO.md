## PRIORITY
Entities: Players and blocks

Saves and loads

Add game file with seed

Chunks are bugged when loading/unloading map (changing settings or menu)

Forbid placing blocks behind the inventory

Forbid getting items in the inventory while it's closed (maybe it can only after been opened once)

Why can't we run while bridging anymore ?
